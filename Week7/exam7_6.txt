MongoDB for Developers. Final Exam. Question 6. My Answer
=========================================================

Final: Question 6
Suppose you have a collection of students of the following form:

{
    "_id" : ObjectId("50c598f582094fb5f92efb96"),
    "first_name" : "John",
    "last_name" : "Doe",
    "date_of_admission" : ISODate("2010-02-21T05:00:00Z"),
    "residence_hall" : "Fairweather",
    "has_car" : true,
    "student_id" : "2348023902",
    "current_classes" : [
        "His343",
        "Math234",
        "Phy123",
        "Art232"
    ]
}

Now suppose that basic inserts into the collection, which only include the last
name, first name and student_id, are too slow. What could potentially improve
the speed of inserts. Check all that apply:

Add an index on last_name, first_name if one does not already exist.
Set w=0, j=0 on writes
Remove all indexes from the collection
Provide a hint to MongoDB that it should not use an index for the inserts
Build a replica set and insert data into the secondary nodes to free up the primary nodes.

Add an index on last_name, first_name if one does not already exist.
Can not be right because we are talking about inserts.
MongoDB Reads vs Writes summary

Remove all indexes from the collection.
Sounds good. Updating of indexes gives the most overhead for insert operations.

Set w=0, j=0 on writes.
Sounds good. It decrease overhead for each insert.

Provide a hint to MongoDB that it should not use an index for the inserts.
Sounds strange. I never heart about this. Let’s say skip for now.

Build a replica set and insert data into the secondary nodes to free up the primary nodes.
Can not be right. We have no possibility to insert data to secondary nodes.

Sorry, there's no such hint (no hint at all) for insert operation, so it won't work.
