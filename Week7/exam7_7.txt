MongoDB for Developers. Final Exam. Question 7. My Answer
=========================================================
Final: Question 7
You have been tasked to cleanup a photosharing database. The database consists
of two collections, albums, and images. Every image is supposed to be in an
album, but there are orphan images that appear in no album. Here are some
example documents (not from the collections you will be downloading).

> db.albums.findOne()
{
    "_id" : 67
    "images" : [
        4745,
        7651,
        15247,
        17517,
        17853,
        20529,
        22640,
        27299,
        27997,
        32930,
        35591,
        48969,
        52901,
        57320,
        96342,
        99705
    ]
}

> db.images.findOne()
{ "_id" : 99705, "height" : 480, "width" : 640 }
From the above, you can conclude that the image with _id = 99705 is in album 67.
It is not an orphan.

Your task is to write a program to remove every image from the images collection
that appears in no album. Or put another way, if an image does not appear in at
least one album, it’s an orphan and should be removed from the images collection.

Start by using mongoimport to import your albums.json and images.json
collections. (Did you notice the links in the previous sentence?)
When you are done removing the orphan images from the collection, there should
be 90,038 documents in the images collection. To prove you did it correctly,
what is the sum of the _id fields from the images collection (you can get this
by writing an aggregation query).

I just wrote it using JavaScript and executed in mongoshell. I realized
straightforward algorithm and it worked slow. I suppose other developers can
find more faster solution and share it with me.

function filter(image) {
    if (db.albums.count({'images': image._id}) == 0)
    {
        db.images.remove({'_id': image._id});
    }
};

function map() {
    emit('_id', this._id);
}

function reduce(key, values) {
    var result = 0;
    if (key === '_id') {
        for(var i = 0; i < values.length; i++)
        {
            result += values[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

db.images.find().forEach(filter);
db.images.mapReduce(map, reduce, {out: {inline: 1}});

It gave the following answer:

{
    "results" : [
        {
            "_id" : "_id",
            "value" : 4499664274
        }
    ],
    "timeMillis" : 1090,
    "counts" : {
        "input" : 90038,
        "emit" : 90038,
        "reduce" : 91,
        "output" : 1
    },
    "ok" : 1,
}

so much faster and easier

db.albums.aggregate (
{$unwind: "$images"},
{$group: {
_id: null,
sum: {$sum: '$images'},
count: {$sum: 1}
}
}
)

Google keeps a record in the cache before they are concealed. So if anyone
should see the cache of search engine for your desired items.
