I believe he is as critical to the organization as all of the \"tier two\" members (and has had a larger p/l contribution).  If you disagree, I need to know so I can appropriately set his expectations.  I look at this list and I cannot discern the standard for inclusion.  This standard must be clear and will be closely watched by all employees.\n\nAndy\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSera, Sherri  \nSent:\tTuesday, June 26, 2001 2:47 PM\nTo:\tHorton, Stanley; Rice, Ken; Hannon, Kevin; Sherriff, John; Delainey, David; Whalley, Greg; Frevert, Mark; Kean, Steven; Fastow, Andrew; Derrick Jr., James; Causey, Richard; Lay, Kenneth\nCc:\tKanouff, Erin; Oxley, David; Williamson, Joannie\nSubject:\tRE: MD PRC Committee\n\nBased on feedback Jeff received from the communication yesterday, the list of additional MD PRC members has been narrowed somewhat.

While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???\n\nAndy\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tUmanoff, Adam  \nSent:\tMonday, April 16, 2001 1:58 AM\nTo:\tFastow, Andrew S.\nSubject:\tMonday Meeting\n\nAndy - Mark Metts called tonight and has asked me not to meet with you in Houston tomorrow.  His stated concern is over disparate/more favorable treatment of you (LJM) as opposed to other bidders for EWC.  As we have discussed, while I am very interested in an LJM financed MBO, at this stage I need you to sort out any process issues with Cliff/Mark and/or Jeff.  Let's meet as soon as that gets worked out.  In the meantime, I won't travel to Houston Monday but will call to chat.  Thanks. Adam",
