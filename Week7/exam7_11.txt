MongoDB for DBA’s. Final Exam. Question 11. My Answer
=====================================================
Final: Final.11

Grab problem11.json from the education site. Import it into a mongo database
(the cluster from the last problem will work fine but an empty configuration
will work as well):

mongoimport -d snps -c problem11 problem11.json

Now, using the aggregation framework, answer the question: how many unique
N2/mutant pairs are there in this collection? (Assume the values as case
sensitive – so ‘a’ and ‘A’ are different values for uniqueness purposes.)

mongos> db.elegans.aggregate([ {$group: { _id: { N2: "$N2", mutant: "$mutant" } }} ]).result.length
It shows me 31
